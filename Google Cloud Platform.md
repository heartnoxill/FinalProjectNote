First, GCP is the cheapest amongst the top three platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) and is less complicated, suitable for people with beginner level of cloud architecture skill. Second, GCP just released the propose of creating a new server region in Thailand to advance the countryâ€™s next phase of economic development. It would be great if we can develop an example of how to use it, so people who is interested in using GCP to develop a solution would start easier.

**Scope**

[[Member]]

Designing and utilizing cloud service to develop data intensive solutions, in this case, develop a [[data platform]] of air quality data to support the [[analysis processes]]. We believe that if people can access the data easier, especially governmental data that is usually messy or in a semi-structured form, they can develop new solutions that could improve our society better.

We will use [[Google Cloud Platform]]
Our reference is [[Data Lakes, Clouds, and Commons A Review of Platforms for Analyzing and Sharing Genomic Data]]

First plan (as of 15/08/2022)
![[Pasted image 20220815121548.png]]

We will use PM data from [[Pollution Control Department]]
They have [[ambient air monitoring stations around Bangkok]]

Other data we need to consider
BUT We need to study what caused air pollution first.
-   Man-made wildfires
-   Construction
-   Manufacturing
-   Communication
-   Other: Smoking, Incense, Burning paper, Fireworks, BBQ,

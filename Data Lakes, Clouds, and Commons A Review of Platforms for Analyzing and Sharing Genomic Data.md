## Highlights

Data commons collate data with cloud computing infrastructure and commonly used software services, tools, and applications to create biomedical resources for the large-scale management, analysis, harmonization, and sharing of biomedical data.

Data commons support repeatable, reproducible, and open research.

Data lakes provide access to a collection of data objects that can accessed via digital IDs and searched via their metadata.

A simple data ecosystem can be built when a data commons exposes an API that can support a collection of third party applications that can access data from the commons. More complex data ecosystems arise when multiple data commons can interoperate and support a collection of third party applications over a common set of core services (framework services), such as services for authentication, authorization, digital IDs, and metadata.
